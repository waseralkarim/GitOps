# Some basic GitHub terminology

### **Repository**

In simple term it is storage location which:

- Stores our code, files and projects datas.
- Tracks the changes in the system.
- Commit history etc.

### **Hashing**

Hashing is one of the core knowledge that is pre requisite for GitHub.

What is hashing value used for?

- It is used for security purposes. For example we can check the file integrity of the downloaded file or software.
- It enables efficient data retrieval and comparison through creating a unique fixed-size output for data of any size. This makes operations like lookups in hash tables very fast.
- Hashing is essential for cryptographic applications like digital signatures and password storage, where it helps verify authenticity without revealing actual data.

We can check the hash value of a file by using this command:

```bash
sha256sum <filename>
```
